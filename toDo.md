# To Do

## Visual Design and Layout

- plan mobile version
  - layout of dropdown navigation and reading list portion
    - Buttons on bottom nav toggle between Bestsellers & Reading List on main screen
    - Bestseller list shows 1 category at a time and you have to click the current category name to get a dropdown that changes what category is displayed?
  - choose css tool to handle screen size breakpoints
  - 
- improve appearance of bestseller list side
- design my own original replacement for cover image if null
- fix top margin of maincontent and take out temporary inline styling of SideNav div.
- replace favicon with icon of books (for tab)

## Functionality

- ~~add timestamp to localStorage & setup to check api for updates to bestsellerlist every so often~~
- hook up links in dropdown of book categories
- create pages for login and signup and wire links to them to buttons
- frontend auth with auth-0
- add reading list functionality
  - demo for if not logged in
  - user version that saves changes to db



## Improvements

- maybe category links should filter bestseller list content instead of jumping down the page?
- fix useCallBack where it wants me to add bestsellerList (which causes too many api calls)
