# To Do

## Visual Design and Layout

- plan mobile version
  - layout of dropdown navigation and reading list portion
  - choose css tool to handle screen size breakpoints
  - 
- improve appearance of bestseller list side
- design my own original replacement for cover image if null
- fix top margin of maincontent and take out temporary inline styling of SideNav div.
- replace favicon with icon of books (for tab)

## Functionality

- hook up links in dropdown of book categories
- create pages for login and signup and wire links to them to buttons
- frontend auth with auth-0
- add reading list functionality
  - demo for if not logged in
  - user version that saves changes to db



## Improvements

- reduce calls to NYT API: use local storage for bestseller list between weekly updates?
- maybe category links should filter bestseller list content instead of jumping down the page?
